# Bookmarklets
_For some reason the github file doesn't want to format correctly, just copy the code into an editor of your choice if you want to go through it._
## What is this?
I found out about bookmarklets and decided to come up with some on my own. In the order presented, these are:
- **Simple Dark Mode** (turns almost any page into dark mode using simple invert filters)
- **Editable Website** (turns any website editable)
- **Add to Clipboard** (adds selected content to clipboard while retaining what was in it before)
- **Notepad** (just two demonstrations of simple notepad websites stored in a bookmarklet)
- **Skip ads on YouTube** (skips ads when clicked on)
- **Remove Banners** (removes login banners on quora and twitter)
- **Open New YouTube Content** (opens newest videos from people from your sublist who have new content)

## How do I use this?
In chrome, click the three dots at the top right, go to bookmarks - bookmark manager. There, click the three dots at the top right of the page and add a new bookmark. Give it a name, and as the URL paste the whole corresponding _javascript: code goes here; void 0;_ snippet. 

## Why is there %23 in the html snippets?
Bookmarks don't really like hashtags. So if you need to format something to be red, you can't just write _color: #F00_, instead you must use _%23_ as a hashtag, so it turns into _color: %23F00_
